// Section 4: Data Caching and Optimization (5 minutes)
// Scenario:
// You have a Node.js application using Redis for caching.
// ‚óè Explain when you would use caching and provide a code snippet to implement
// caching for frequently accessed data in Redis

/**
 * redis is in memory data storage we can store fequently used data like tokens and can be accessed when needed.
 * 
 * we can check whether data is found in redis if not we can fetch from database and store it in redis as hashed value or as string as per requirement
